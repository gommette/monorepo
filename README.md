# About

**Gommette** is a geosocial mobile game that encourages players to explore their surroundings and connect with others through **digital stickers**. Each day, users receive a random pack of stickers with messages, which they can pin to specific geolocations. Players can pick up stickers left by others if they are physically present at that location. The game also allows users to create custom designs, contribute to the map with respawn locations, and participate in sponsored quests for unique stickers. Gommette aims to promote local exploration, foster a community-driven experience, and, in the long run, replace generic stickers with user-designed content for an ever-evolving gaming adventure :v:
